LLR README
----------
This is a simple library to calculate log likelihood ratios, p-values, and
number of standard deviations (assuming gaussian fluctuations).

See LLR.h for documentation on functions.
See main.cxx for an example of how to use the functions in LLR.h.

In order to build the example, run "make" in this directory, then call

$ ./main input_file.root sm_histname bsm_histname0 [bsm_histname1 ...]

to calculate the nsigma deviations that bsm_histname0 [bsm_histname1 ...]
have from the sm_histname template. bsm_histnameX and
sm_histname must be histograms in input_file.root.

Obviously you can write your own equivalent to "main.cxx" which fits
your needs.
